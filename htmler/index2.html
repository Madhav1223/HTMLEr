    <h1 class="h1">Object Oriented Programming</h1>

    <div class="parent1">
      <h2 class="h1">Introduction to OOP</h2>
      <div class="child1">
        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that
        organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions
        and logic.
      </div>
      <div class="child2">
        OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather
        than the logic required to manipulate them. This includes manufacturing
        simulation and mobile apps.
      </div>
      <div class="child3">
        OOP benefits collaborative development, and promotes code reusability,
        scalability and efficiency.
      </div>
      <div class="child4">
        The first step is identifying objects and how they relate â€” known as
        data modeling.
      </div>
      <div class="child5">
        Objects belong to classes that define their data and behavior. They
        interact through well-defined interfaces called messages.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="parent2">
      <h2 class="h2">Features of OOP</h2>
      <div class="child1">1. Emphasis is on data rather than procedures.</div>
      <div class="child2">2. Programs are divided into objects.</div>
      <div class="child3">
        3. Function and data are tied together in a single unit.
      </div>
      <div class="child4">
        4. Data access is through visible functions enabling object
        communication.
      </div>
      <div class="child5">5. Data structures are modeled as objects.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="parent3">
      <h2 class="h2">Class</h2>
      <div class="child1">
        A Class is a user-defined data-type containing data members and member
        functions defining properties and behavior of its objects.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="parent4">
      <h2 class="h2">Object</h2>
      <div class="child1">
        An Object is an instance of a Class that occupies memory and has
        attributes and behaviors defined by its class.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="parent5">
      <h2 class="h2">Encapsulation</h2>
      <div class="child1">
        Encapsulation binds data and functions into a single unit, hiding
        internal details and only exposing necessary components.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="parent6">
      <h2 class="h2">Inheritance</h2>
      <div class="child1">
        Inheritance allows a new class to acquire the properties and behaviors
        of an existing class.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="parent7">
      <h2 class="h2">Polymorphism</h2>
      <div class="child1">
        Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent
        class, supporting multiple forms of behavior.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="parent8">
      <h2 class="h2">Abstraction</h2>
      <div class="child1">
        Abstraction reduces complexity by hiding unnecessary details and
        exposing only essential features.
      </div>
    </div>
